# Bankcruptcy prediction using machine learning techniques
This repository contains test scripts for my diploma. I test different models and data preparation techniques here.

## Models for testing:
Logistic regression,
Gradient boosting,
Bagging classifier,
Natural gradient boosting,
SVM,
Random forests,
Decision trees.
